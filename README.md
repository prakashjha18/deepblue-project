Worked on problem statement Predict Queue Wait time in hospitals over the course of 3 months. proposed a GUI based solution to give the predicted time taken by the patient for an available doctor based on the parameters provided which are patients age, type and arrival time, the prediction is done using random forest regression technique the accuracy of our model is around 70%, once the patient gets register he/she will get an SMS of their consultancy time taken and the total wait time they have to wait for their consultancy to take place, we have also implemented the feature of multiple doctors and thier total wait time in queue, real-time feature of giving the count of number of people present in reception
